\section{Introduction (Rolf)}
This report is part of the bachelor end project on anonymous video streaming on tablets. In this project we attempt to get Tribler, a peer-to-peer file sharing application working anonymously on android using an already implemented Tor-like protocol.

Tribler has been developed at Delft University of Technology, by the Parallel and Distributed Systems group. It is a new peer-to-peer file sharing tool that is completely decentralized. It has been in development for over 9 years and has a very mature and well-established code-base. An anonymous networking protocol based on Tor and implemented in Python is part of a new beta version of Tribler.

In this report we outline the details of the assignment. We will describe the methodology we will use and how we will structure this project. Finally a measurable quality assurance is given.
