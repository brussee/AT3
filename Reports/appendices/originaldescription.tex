	Project description\cite{originalprojectdescription}\\
	
	In this project, a prototype of an anonymous P2P-based video-on-demand mobile application will be realized, that will allow users to search for videos on the Internet. Once the user has found a video to his or her liking, and issued a play command, the application will play the video by means of streaming it through a P2P-based network. TOR is the market leading solution for anonymous web access. The Tribler team has created a P2P implementation of the TOR prototocol and enhanced it with NAT puncturing and decentralized the directory service. Your task is to take the existing operational Python code, initial Android code and make it ready for deployment towards the Google Android Play app marketplace. Challenges are getting M2Crypto crypto libraries operational, Python wrappers, VLC playback integration, multi-device compatibility and User Interface realization.\\
