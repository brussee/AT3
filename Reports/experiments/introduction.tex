In this chapter, we will discuss several experiments we have conducted. Since our application will be used for anonymous downloading and streaming of movies, we are interested in how our final application will perform and whether it is feasible to stream and watch movies on a smartphone. Our measurements can be divided in two categories: an analysis of the CPU usage and an analysis of the download speed.

First a theoretical analysis is given in section \ref{sec:experiments:theoretical} which states the minimum performance required for video streaming. Next, we discuss how we have set up the experiments in section \ref{sec:experiments:approach}. The actual measurements are provided in section \ref{sec:experiments:measurements}. Finally, we discuss our findings in section \ref{sec:experiments:conclusion}
