\section{Introduction}
	In this chapter, we will discuss several experiments we have conducted. Since our application will be used for anonymous streaming of movies, we are interested in how our final application will perform and whether it is feasible to stream and watch movies.
	
	First, we will give a theoretical analysis of our application. We discuss the bitrate we need and elaborate the CPU power need need for our application to run. After that, we describe the process to extract graphs and information from our application. Our measurements can be divided in two categories: an analysis of the CPU usage and an analysis of the download speed. Both CPU and download speed are limited on the mobile device. We will end this chapter with our conclusions.
