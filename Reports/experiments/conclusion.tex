\section{Conclusion}
	We come to the conclusion that most of our expectations are plausible. Increasing the number of circuits while keeping the amount of hops the same results in an high average download speed. Increasing the hops indeed cause a negative impact on the download rates as there is a higher change of packet loss or a bottleneck in the circuit.
	
	The unforeseen CPU bound that we encountered means that the current generation smartphones are not powerful enough to run the anontunnels with both anonymity and encryption. If we assume that the relay nodes do not inspect the data, anonymous downloading is possible. The anontunnels will be able to run on smartphones with both 3 hops and encryption once more powerful hardware becomes available. It is anounced \cite{armv8anouncement} that the new ARM architecture (armv8) will support AES hardware acceleration which should speed up things greatly. We also talked with Niels, one of the lead developers of the Tribler group. He told us that if we manage to get the \emph{gmpy} python package to work on Android, this will speed up the Diffie-Hellman handshakes as well. Since we do not have the time to compile this at this stage, it is not available in our project.	
	
	As long as there are no devices available running the new ARM architecture, our conclusion is that the anontunnels will not be able to run tunnels with three hops and encryption enabled.
