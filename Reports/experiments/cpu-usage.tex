\section{CPU usage}
	The anontunnels create a Tribler session, run multiple cryptographic functions and are relaying and downloading data. Each of these operations require CPU utilization. As this application will be merged with the other bachelor end group (TSAP), we have to make sure that the CPU still has computational power available for the video playback.
	
	To ensure this, we have ran some CPU usage tests under three activities:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Measure CPU usage when idle, that is going from idle trying to create circuits and then back to idle.
		\item Measure CPU usage when downloading. This means going from idle to creating circuits and download a test file.
		\item Measure CPU usage when relaying. This means going from idle to creating circuits to pass on data that is downloaded by another node in the network.
	\end{enumerate}
