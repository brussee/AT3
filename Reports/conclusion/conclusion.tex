\chapter{Conclusion}
	We come to the conclusion that the current generation smartphones are not ready yet for anontunnels, without gmpy. The project itself was successful; we managed to cross-compile all required libraries. The anontunnels are running and downloading when the hop count is low. Downloading over multiple circuits is possible and relaying of data works too. By creating a pull request, we hope to provide the Python for Android with some useful recipes we created during our bachelor project, contributing to the open source community. 
	All of our work, including this report, is open source and can be extended. Jaap van Touw, a master student currently working for the Tribler group, will merge our project with the other bachelor project group TSAP, creating an application that allows anonymous and encrypted downloading of movies, with a search and playback option.
	
	
	Once smartphones running on ARMv8 become available or if gmpy is integrated in the project, we foresee that this application will be able to run with 3 hops and multiple circuits. Once that is possible, Tribler takes a censorship-free internet to a new level.
	
	\section{Recommendations}
		If one wishes to extend our work, we recommend to try and get gmpy to compile by creating a recipe for it. This might speed up the cryptographic part, allowing for multiple hop with encryption downloading. This recipe can also be pull requested to the Python for Android GitHub repository.
		
		We would also recommend working closely together with the Tribler team, as the application integrates the code of the Tribler main code base. The Tribler team often can help with question or advise you on best practice regarding their code.
		
		Finally, we recommend to keep up-to-date with dependencies whenever you can. The Tribler code base changes regularly, so it is good practice to keep up-to-date. Other libraries such as OpenSSL have had some fixes regarding the famous Heartbleed bug. Applying patches like these might be critical in terms of functionality or security.
		
	\section{Reflections}
	
		\subsection{Reflection Rolf}
		In contrast to a traditional Bachelor project where one goes through a software development process, we have decided to take a more research oriented approach. As I aim for an academic career, this bachelor project fits my personal goals very well.
		
		The team worked together excellently with no problems in cooperation. Despite working on separate components simultaneously, everyone was kept up to date with the latest developments. Throughout the project each member shifted focus to different parts of the problem. This allowed every one of us to grasp different aspects of this project.
		
		Our project was about porting and running bleeding edge experimental code on exotic devices and systems. This was challenging in particular because it was uncharted territory. At the start of the project it was not sure if it would be possible to get all Tribler code and dependencies working on Android. I am glad that through hard work and effort we were able to accomplish this. Parts of our work are going to be contributed to open source software and Tribler. Contributing to an open and censorship-free Internet in this way is worth all the work we have put into this and I am happy to have been a part of it.
