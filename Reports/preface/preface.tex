This document describes the bachelor end project we performed at the TU Delft. Without the aid of many people at the TU Delft (and outside), this project would not be possible. In particular, we would like to thank the following people: \\

\emph{Johan Pouwelse}, for his excellent guidance, deep insights and feedback.\\

\emph{Steeve Morin}, who visited Delft to help us with libtorrent. We are grateful for that.\\

\emph{Arvid Norberg}, who helped us debugging the segmentation fault with his excellent knowledge of libtorrent.\\

\emph{The Tribler team}, for always be able to help us with problems and questions.
