This document describes the bachelor project we performed at the TU Delft. Without the help of certain people at the TU Delft (and outside), this project would not be possible. In particular, we would like to thank the following people: \\

\emph{Johan Pouwelse}, for his excellent guidance, deep insights and feedback.\\

\emph{The Tribler team}, for always being able to help us with problems and questions.\\

\emph{Jaap van Touw}, for taking the time to review our final report.\\

\emph{Steeve Morin}, who visited Delft to help us with libtorrent.\\

\emph{Arvid Norberg}, who helped us fix the libtorrent segmentation fault.
