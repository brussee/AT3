This document describes the bachelor thesis we performed at the TU Delft. Without the aid of many people at the TU Delft (and outside), this project would not be possible. In particular, we would like to thank the following people: \\

\emph{Johan Pouwelse}, for his excellent guidance, deep insights and feedback.\\

\emph{Steeve Morin}, who visited Delft to help us with libtorrent.\\

\emph{Arvid Norberg}, who helped us debug the libtorrent segmentation fault\\

\emph{The Tribler team}, for always be able to help us with problems and questions.
