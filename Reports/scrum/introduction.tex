\section{Introduction}
We decided to do sprints of two weeks, where every day we perform our daily scrum. At the end of each week we evaluate the current goals and where we stand. Based on our current progress the feasibility of the goals is evaluated and the goals are adjusted when needed.

Per iteration we present the goals and milestones that were initially set. All these goals and milestones are logged on the Github repository as issues and assigned to the team members. The progress of each individual item is evaluated and we describe any necessary adjustments. Finally a new set of goals is presented for the next scrum.
