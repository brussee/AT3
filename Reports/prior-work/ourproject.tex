\section{Our project}
	We have discussed Tor, Tribler and have explained some libraries that Tribler is using and Python for Android. In this section, we will give an overview of our activities for the upcoming weeks.
		
	The idea is to port the experimental code of pull request 525 to the Android device. This experimental code is written in Python so we have two options: either write the code of the anonymous tunnels in Java or use the Python for Android library to run the Python code on an Android device. Running the Python code on Android is the most appealing option and is less error-prone than rewriting all the anontunnels code in another language.. The Global Square already worked on porting some libraries we need to the Android so we can extend on their work. There are some other libraries we have to port such as libtorrent and Dispersy. Overall, this project will not be easy, but if we succeed, it could be a big step towards anonymous streaming on Android devices.
