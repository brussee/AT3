In this chapter, we will describe existing frameworks and software we can use. The largest anonymous network available now is Tor. We look at the advantages and disadvantages of Tor. Another way to anonymously share files, can be found in the Tribler software.
	
Since Tribler is written in Python, we need a framework that executes Python code on an Android device. Python for Android provides these tools and we will explain why and how we are using it in Section \ref{sec:p4a}. In Section \ref{sec:tor} we will review Tor, the current standard to communicate anonymously. Next, in Section \ref{sec:tribler} we will talk about Tribler. Tribler has implemented its own Tor-like protocol and aims for complete decentralization. Finally, The Global Square will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:tgs}. The Global Square contributed to both Python for Android and the Tribler project.
