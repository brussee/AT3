\section{Introduction}
	
	
	In this research, we will first describe the Python for Android framework, and why we are using it. Followed by section \ref{scc:motivation}, we motivate the move to the mobile platform Android. After that, we will describe the Tor network in section \ref{scc:tor} and look into its advantages and disadvantages. Next, the focus will move to Tribler and we will discuss the Tribler system in section \ref{scc:tribler}. In section \ref{scc:p4a}, we will discuss a library that allows to run Python code on an Android device: Python for Android. One of the contributers to Python for Android is The Global Square. We will explain what The Global Square exactly is and what their goals are in section \ref{scc:tgs}. Finally, we will discuss how we will be using the discussed software for our projects and we will elaborate what our project exactly is and what it does.
