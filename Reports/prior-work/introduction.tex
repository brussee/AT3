In this chapter, we will discuss existing frameworks and software we can use. The largest anonymous network available now is Tor. We look at the advantages and disadvantages of Tor. Another way to anonymously share files, can be found in the Tribler software. We will see how Tribler works and how we can use the existing software.
	
Since Tribler is written in Python, we need a framework to be able to execute Python code on an Android device. Python for Android provides these tools and we will explain why and how we are using it. We will also discuss a contributor to the Python for Android: The Global Square. We describe what The Global Square is. This chapter will end with a discussion how we will be using the discussed software for our projects and we will elaborate what our project exactly is and what it does.
