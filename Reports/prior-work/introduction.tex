Quite a few work has already been done on the subject of anonymity. In this chapter, we will discuss existing frameworks and software we can probably use. The largest anonymous network available now is Tor. We will see the advantages and disadvantages of Tor and using the Tor network. Another anonymous system that is in development is Tribler. We will see how Tribler works and how we can extend on this software.
	
Since Tribler is written in Python, we need a framework to be able to execute Python code on an Android device. Python for Android provides these tools and we will explain why and how we are using it. We will also discuss a contributor to the Python for Android: The Global Square. We describe what The Global Square exactly is and what their goals are. This chapter will end with a discussion how we will be using the discussed software for our projects and we will elaborate what our project exactly is and what it does.
