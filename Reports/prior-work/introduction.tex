In this chapter, we will discuss existing frameworks and software we can use. The largest anonymous network available now is Tor. We look at the advantages and disadvantages of Tor. Another way to anonymously share files, can be found in the Tribler software. We will see how Tribler works and how we can use the existing software.
	
Since Tribler is written in Python, we need a framework to be able to execute Python code on an Android device.
In this chapter, we will first describe the Python for Android framework, and why we are using it. After that, we will describe the Tor network in Section \ref{scc:tor} and look into its advantages and disadvantages. Next, in Section \ref{scc:tribler} the focus will move to Tribler and we will discuss the Tribler application. In Section \ref{scc:tgs}, we will discuss The Global Square. We will explain what The Global Square exactly is and what their goals are. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:our-project} we will elaborate how we will be using the discussed software for our projects and we will elaborate what our project exactly is and what it does.
