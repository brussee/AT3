\section{The Global Square}
	\label{sec:tgs}
	One of Tribler's contributors is The Global Square\footnote{\url{http://www.global-square.net/}}. This organization has made contributions to Dispersy and libswift\footnote{\url{http://libswift.org/}}. They also worked on the Python for Android library and documented the necessary steps to compile the libraries used by Tribler in Python for Android. Currently, TGS has become inactive and are no longer contributing.
	
	Roarmag, an online journal writing about the global struggle for democracy, published a proposal in 2011 describing The Global Square: an online platform for our movement \cite{theglobalsquare}. Their proposal is to make an online platform where people of all nations can come together as equals. This platform could be used to participate in the coordination of collective actions. It could provide the following tools:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An interactive map that lists all ongoing assemblies around the world.
		\item A search option to find squares and events.
		\item Individual pages for each local square/assembly where they can organize events and share information.
		\item A public and private messaging system so individual users and groups can communicate with each other.
	\end{itemize}
	Traditional social media such as Facebook and Twitter, only allow to share and promote content, while TGS encourages the active participation of citizens and the consolidation of working groups in a local and global context between individuals and assemblies.
	
	TGS has their own GitHub repository where they host contributions to various projects \cite{theglobalsquaregithub}. Notable are the contributions to the libswift and Dispersy projects. The last commits to these projects are over a year ago.
		
	Another important contribution has been done to the Python for Android project. TGS has added the libswift, netifaces and M2Crypto libraries to the Python for Android project, making it possible to create an Android application bundle with these libraries included. This is an important contribution because it can be used as a first step to implement Tribler or anonymous tunnels on an Android device.
