	Worldwide the amount of smartphones is growing fast. In 2013, there were 6.8 billion mobile subscriptions worldwide \cite{itustatistics}. This number is expected to exceed the world population in 2014 with 7.3 billion subscriptions. Android had a share of 81\% in Q3 of devices shipped \cite{forbesandroidmarket}, this shows that there is a lot of potential gain on the Android market. 

	Besides the arguments stated above, a mobile application is an excellent way to attract more new users to Tribler. While the Tor project does have an Android application named Orbot, this application does not provide anonymous file transfer \cite{tororbot, googleplayorbot}. Orbot only serves as an anonymous proxy. Also, the structure of Tor is currently semi-centralized \cite{jagerman2014fifteen} where this application will be completely decentralized using Dispersy as synchronization system \cite{zeilemaker2013dispersy}. This means that this application will be less vulnerable to attacks that are targeted against central components of the network, as there are less. Moreover, this application can easily scale where Tor is restricted to 1.2 million nodes \cite{mclachlan2009scalable}. With the billions of smartphones out there the and no competition in this area, this application has a lot of potential to open a new way of anonymous file sharing while being independent of computers.
