	Tribler is a decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing system. Recently the Tribler development team has introduced anonymous internet communication using a Tor-like protocol in their beta version. The goal of our bachelor end project is to port their technology to Android devices. This is a challenging task because cross compiling the necessary libraries such as libtorrent to the ARM CPU architecture is uncharted territory. We have successfully ported all dependencies of Tribler to Android. An application called AT3 has been developed that tests whether these libraries work. This application downloads a test torrent and measures critical information such as CPU usage and download speed. Based on this information we have concluded that it is currently not viable to run the anonymous tunnels on a smartphone. Running several layers of encryption is very computationally expensive and modern smartphones can not keep up. With future developments such as the ARMv8 architecture which support hardware AES encryption, running the anonymous tunnels might become possible.
