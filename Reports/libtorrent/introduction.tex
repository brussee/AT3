A big part of our project was to create a stable version of libtorrent on the Android device. To do this, we have to cross compile libtorrent for  Android which contains an ARM chipset. To compile libtorrent, we make use of a custom toolchain we created from the tools that are bundled with the Android ndk.
	
In this section, we will explain the compilation process, including the tools and commands needed to successfully compile libtorrent with Python bindings. We will first focus on setting up the environment. After the environment has been setup, the compilation of Boost is discussed. Finally, the compilation of libtorrent with Python bindings itself is explained.
