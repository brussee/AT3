On of the major goals of our project was to create a stable version of libtorrent capable of running on an Android device. To do this, we have to cross compile libtorrent for  Android which contains an ARM chipset. To compile libtorrent, we make use of a custom toolchain we created from the tools that are bundled with the Android NDK.
