\section{Introduction}
	A big challenge of our project was to have a stable version of libtorrent on the Android phone. We have to cross compile libtorrent for the Android device which contains an ARM chipset. To compile libtorrent, we use a custom toolchain we create from the tools that are bundled with the Android ndk.
	
	In this section, we will explain the compilation process, including the tools and steps needed to successfully compile libtorrent with Python bindings. We will first focus on setting up the environment. After the environment has been setup, compiling Boost is discussed. After that, the compilation of libtorrent itself is explained. Finally, the compilation and linking of the Python bindings is discussed.
