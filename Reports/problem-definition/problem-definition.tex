% uitleggen wat streaming, downloading/anonymous is
% linkjes bij de bullets maken

In this bachelor project we want to answer the following question:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Can we anonymously download and stream videos on Android\footnote{http://www.android.com/about/}?}
\end{quote}

Our focus within this question is on anonymous communication. We want to get Tribler, anonymous communication and all necessary dependencies working on Android smartphones. For the project to succeed, the following criteria must be met:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We must be able to run Python code on Android because Tribler is written in the Python programming language.
\item We must compile the following necessary dependencies to run on Android devices using the ARM\footnote{http://www.arm.com/} architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item libtorrent
\item OpenSSL\footnote{http://www.openssl.org/}
\item M2Crypto\footnote{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/M2Crypto}
\item PyCrypto\footnote{https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/}
\item APSW\footnote{https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw}
\item netifaces\footnote{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces}
\end{itemize}
\item We must be able to successfully download a file over the anonymous tunnels using the ported code.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Motivation}
	\label{sec:motivation}
		In this section we will motivate the research question. Worldwide the amount of smartphones is growing fast. Android had a share of 81\% in the third quarter of 2013\cite{forbesandroidmarket}. As stated in the introduction, there are more than one billion active mobile users. This means Tribler can reach a huge audience by going Android. Moreover, this application can easily scale by using Dispersy, where Tor is restricted to 1.2 million nodes \cite{mclachlan2009scalable}. If mobile devices would start to serve as relay nodes, Tribler is ready for it.
