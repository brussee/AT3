\section{Libtorrent}
	Our work was greatly dependent on one of the world's most popular libraries: libtorrent. Since so much time and effort has gone into libtorrent  we decided to create a separate tutorial about the compilation process. This guide is available in appendix \ref{cpt:libtorrent}. This means that other people can extend our work and use our building process to compile libtorrent for their own purposes. In the future, a recipe that performs the compilation process of libtorrent can be made.
	
	When compiling libtorrent, we used the Boost library that provides advanced C++\footnote{http://www.cplusplus.com} features such as memory management and support for multi-threading. We made use of libtorrent-rasterbar's Python bindings to invoke the libtorrent library in Python code.
