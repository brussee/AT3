\section{Tribler}
	One of our biggest contributions to the Tribler team is this project. Our created prototype allows anonymous downloads via the experimental anontunnels code. that runs the experimental anontunnels code. This application also made use of the main Tribler code.
	
	A future goal is that our application will be merged with the project of the other bachelor project group. This means that we will have an application that allows searching the Dispersy communities and anonymously download / stream torrent movies. An extension of Tribler to the mobile platform could be a big step towards anonymous and safe communication.
	
	During the process, we identified several issues regarding the anontunnels and Tribler itself. Some of these issues were fixed and we are content that we could contribute to the stability of Tribler. During the project, we had close contact with the Tribler team and we spoke regularly with members over mail, IRC or in person.
