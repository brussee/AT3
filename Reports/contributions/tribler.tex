\section{Tribler}
	One of our biggest contributions is the one to the Tribler team. We created an Android application that allows anonymous downloads. We made use of the existing anontunnels code and the main Tribler code, written by the Tribler team.
	
	The future goal is that our application will be merged with the project of the other group. This means that we will have an application that allows searching the Dispersy communities and anonymously stream torrent movies. An extension of Tribler to the mobile platform could be a big step towards anonymous and safe communication.
	
	During the process, we identified several issues regarding the anontunnels and Tribler itself. Some of these issues were fixed and we are content that we could contribute to the stability of Tribler. During the project, we had close contact with the Tribler team and we spoke regularly with members over mail, IRC or in person.
