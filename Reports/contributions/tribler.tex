\section{Tribler}
	Our created prototype provides the option to download anonymously using the experimental anontunnels code. This application also uses the Tribler core code. A future goal is that our application will be merged with the Tribler Play project. This means that we will have an application that allows searching the Dispersy communities and anonymously download / stream torrent movies. An extension of Tribler to the mobile platform could be a big step towards anonymity on the internet.
	
	During the process, we identified several issues regarding the anontunnels and Tribler itself. Some of these issues were fixed and we contributed to the stability of Tribler. During the project, we had close contact with the Tribler team and we spoke regularly with members over mail, IRC or in person.
