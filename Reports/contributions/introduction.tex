\section{Introduction}
	During our bachelor thesis, we used many open source libraries and frameworks. In addition, we had aid from several people, ranging from Stack Overflow to Steeve Norin who personally came to help us. In this chapter, we will describe our contribution to the world of open source software, explain what we have managed and what we have done to make software people can use and extend on. In this chapter we will describe our contributions to Python for Android, libtorrent and Tribler and explain which other projects we used.
